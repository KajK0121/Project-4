## Introduction

We're on a mission to use medical info like age, gender, BMI, and blood glucose levels to predict if someone is likely to have diabetes. The dataset covers ages 18 to 75, with each person giving us important details.

In this dataset, we've got a mix of basic info like age and gender, along with more detailed stuff like BMI and blood glucose levels. Our main goal is to find out if someone has diabetes or not.

We're exploring this data to find patterns that could help us spot diabetes early. By using simple and detailed info, we hope to make predictions that can be useful for both people and doctors. Our aim is to use data to make healthcare decisions that aren't just reactions but are based on information, helping both patients and healthcare providers.

So, let's dive into this medical data and see if we can find signs of diabetes and maybe even prevent it.

## Data_Overview

## Data_Cleaning
We read in the csv onto jupyter notebook in order to clean the data. The codes below shows how we removed any null values and 0 values. Our dataset was pretty clean as it was.

We then exported the cleaned data to SQLite and tested the database in Jupyter Notebook
